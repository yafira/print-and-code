# print + code (fall 2025)

A documentation hub for my **Print & Code** work—an exploration of computational craft where **ink, paper, and algorithms** live in the same workflow. This site collects projects, process traces, scans, datasets, and source code, tracing how images are generated, materialized, and iterated across digital and physical contexts.

## sections

- **riso animation** — print as a time-based system (digital → analog → digital)
- **design system** — code as layout logic + data-driven composition
- **machine drawing** — plotter as collaborator; parametric editions
- **experimental publications** — tutorial as art; dataset publication; parody + archives

## projects included

### riso animation
**sailor moon inspired riso animation**  
p5 sketch → frame extraction → riso print → scan → loop assembly

### design system
**the department of lost circuits**  
generative postage series built in p5.js using a dataset of discontinued devices  
includes a riso-ready halftone workflow + generative border system

### machine drawing
**magnetic core memory**  
p5 + svg plotter drawing inspired by woven memory planes (slow computation)

### experimental publications
**how to touch electricity**  
a soft circuits zine + small kit (tutorial as art)

**debug.log — a system trying its best**  
an experimental publication built from collected error messages + tender interpretations

## built with

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- project-specific work created with **p5.js**

## live demo
