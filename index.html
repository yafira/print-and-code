            <div class="content">
              <p>
                For this project I created a Sailor Moon inspired risograph animation. Sailor Moon was my favorite anime
                growing up, so it felt natural to return to it as a source of visual language and nostalgia. The main
                element
                I animated was the star symbol, which rotates as the central motion. At first I experimented with bold,
                bright
                colors, but once I printed it I realized they came out much harsher than expected. That was a surprise,
                something
                that looked more soft and luminous on screen appeared almost overwhelming in print. This led me to make
                a second
                version with pastel tones.
              </p>

              <p>
                I like that the adjusted yellow and gold almost resemble a stamped texture, which gives the piece a
                tactile
                quality. Another detail I especially enjoy is the dithering effect produced by the risograph process.
                The
                halftone dots and gradients create a textured look that makes the animation feel layered and physical,
                giving
                it a softness that could not be fully replicated digitally. It also connects back to the retro anime and
                manga
                aesthetic of Sailor Moon itself, which often used screen tones and grainy textures to create atmosphere.
              </p>

              <h4>Digital vs Analogue Workflows</h4>
              <p>
                The production process highlighted the difference between digital and analogue workflows. In my p5.js
                sketch,
                the animation feels smoother and more dynamic because the code generates movement continuously.
                Translating
                that into a frame-based risograph sequence required me to limit the motion to discrete stills. I ended
                up
                producing many frames, but paradoxically the effect was less animated than my original sketch. It made
                me think
                more carefully about how few frames are needed to suggest motion effectively, and where excess becomes
                static.
              </p>

              <h4>Glitch and Noise</h4>
              <p>
                The process also connected to our readings on glitch and noise. In the translation from screen to print
                and back
                to screen (digital → analog → digital), unexpected forms of noise appeared. Color shifts, uneven
                textures,
                dithering, and slight misalignments worked as glitches that added character. Instead of being errors,
                these
                became aesthetic features, reminding me of how compression artifacts or VHS static, once considered
                flaws, now
                read as nostalgic or stylistic choices. I was surprised by how much I welcomed these "imperfections."
                They gave
                the animation a tactile richness that my p5 version lacked.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  <strong>The Actual Process:</strong> The process moved through several stages across both digital and
                  analog
                  tools. I first developed the sketch in p5.js, testing out colors, movement, and frame counts in code.
                  Once I had
                  the star animation working digitally, I separated the frames and prepared them for print at the riso
                  lab. Printing
                  was its own experiment—colors shifted, layering created unexpected textures, and the dithering
                  patterns emerged
                  through the risograph's limitations.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                After printing, I scanned the individual frames back into the computer and compiled them in Adobe
                Photoshop, where
                I built contact sheets to organize the sequence. From there, I assembled the frames into an animation,
                layering them
                back together into a moving loop. Each step introduced its own character: coding produced smooth
                continuous motion,
                printing introduced tactile noise and color shifts, scanning translated those textures into pixels, and
                finally
                Photoshop restructured the sequence into a cohesive animation.
              </p>

                <div class="gallery-item">
                  <img src="assets/animation/recording.gif" alt="final loop recording gif" loading="lazy" />
                  <div class="gallery-caption">final loop</div>
                </div>

              <h4>Reflection</h4>
              <p>
                I would probably recreate this animation again and try my best to cut the frames so it won't have such a
                wobbly
                effect. Nonetheless I am content with the riso texture it brings to life.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reflecting on this project, I see glitch and noise not as disruptions but as collaborators in the
                process. They make
                the work feel less polished and more human, carrying traces of the materials and machines involved. That
                tension between
                my controlled digital sketch and the noisy analogue print revealed how animation can live across
                mediums, each step
                introducing its own unexpected variations. Ultimately, this project reminded me that part of animating
                is allowing the
                process to transform the image, even when it veers away from what I initially imagined.

          <p>
            Over the past few weeks, I've been developing <em>The Department of Lost Circuits</em>, a generative postage
            series that reimagines obsolete electronics as collectible design artifacts. Each stamp in the series
            represents
            a different historical device, from Braun radios and Sharp pocket computers to the Nintendo Game Boy Sewing
            Machine. The stamps are not only visual tributes but also data-driven compositions that weave together
            information about the object's design, production era, and technological lineage.
          </p>

          <h4>Why Stamps?</h4>
          <figure class="inline-figure">
            <img src="assets/ds/stamp.png" alt="single stamp detail" loading="lazy" />
            <figcaption class="muted">single stamp detail</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Postage stamps are tiny monuments. They preserve histories that nations decide are worth circulating:
            people,
            landmarks, inventions. I chose stamps because they feel both antique and ceremonial, a perfect match for
            technology
            that has slipped from the present. They are archival but personal, handled by many, collected by few.
            Turning obsolete
            devices into stamps restores a sense of dignity to objects often discarded without a second thought.
          </p>

          <h4>Data as Design Material</h4>
          <p>
            Each stamp is generated in code using p5.js, combining algorithmic layouts with historical metadata. The
            layout system
            establishes a strict visual hierarchy: product image at center, year and manufacturer below, rarity stars in
            the upper
            corner, and price or value markers framed in minimalist black circles. These visual anchors create a rhythm
            across the
            sheet, referencing both typographic order and the archival precision of catalog systems.
          </p>

          <figure class="inline-figure">
            <img src="assets/ds/data.png" alt="dataset mapping image" loading="lazy" />
            <figcaption class="muted">dataset structure + mapping</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p class="muted">
            The dataset now includes <strong>40 discontinued devices</strong> spanning 1961–2016. A new field,
            <strong>material_components</strong>, documents each device's "material afterlife"—what these devices become
            when
            discarded: cathode ray tubes and leaded glass, lithium polymer batteries and magnetic tape oxide,
            polycarbonate shells
            and copper circuit traces.
          </p>

          <h4>Creating the Border System</h4>
          <p>
            A key recent addition has been the border system. Previously, every stamp shared a simple perforated
            outline. Now, each
            stamp randomly generates one of several unique border styles, including perforated, dotted, zigzag, and
            scalloped frames.
            The scalloped style, inspired by traditional postage silhouettes, adds a tactile sense of authenticity and
            rhythm to the
            grid. The generative variation keeps the sheet visually dynamic, like a philatelic field of tiny
            architectures.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            I also integrated material metadata into the composition. Each object's CSV entry now includes its
            material_components.
            These materials are represented as small geometric glyphs positioned beneath the image. The system parses
            the text
            automatically, identifying material keywords and rendering a set of icons that mirror industrial design
            language.

              halftone layers (black + teal, later changed to baby blue + fluorescent pink), optimized for risograph
              output. Where
              they overlap, a surprising purple emerges—a happy accident that reinforces the theme.

            <div class="details-content">
              <p>
                As part of preparing The Department of Lost Circuits for Risograph printing, I've been working with
                halftone
                dithering to convert digital images into printable ink patterns. The method I'm using is based on a
                <strong>Bayer
                  matrix</strong>, a small repeating grid that decides how dots of ink are distributed to represent
                different shades
                of gray.
              </p>

              <h4>What a Bayer Matrix Does</h4>
              <p>
                When a photograph is printed in a single color of ink, it can't rely on RGB values. Instead, it creates
                the illusion
                of tone by varying dot density. The Bayer matrix helps organize this process by assigning a threshold to
                each pixel.
              </p>

              <p>
                Smaller matrices (like 4×4) produce chunkier, high-contrast textures, while larger ones (like 8×8)
                result in
                smoother gradients. The choice affects the print's personality: 4×4 is bold and graphic, great for
                low-detail images
                or strong contrast; 8×8 gives smoother tones, ideal for photographs and subtle shading.
              </p>

              <h4>Why It Works Well for RISO</h4>
              <p>
                The Risograph is a mechanical stencil printer, so it loves predictable dot patterns. Ordered dithering
                produces clean,
                geometric textures that don't blur or misalign easily. Because this project combines industrial imagery
                and archival
                layouts, the Bayer matrix fits conceptually too—it bridges digital precision with the analog
                imperfections of RISO
                printing, where each dot is both mechanical and expressive.
              </p>

              <pre><code>// TEAL PLATE (RISO): auto-levels → Bayer dither → place on layer
function drawImageHalftone_toLayer(layer, d, x, y, w, h) {
  const margin = 45;
  const imgX = x + STAMP_INSET + margin;
  const imgY = y + STAMP_INSET + margin;
  const imgW = w - (STAMP_INSET + margin) * 2;
  const imgH = h - (STAMP_INSET + margin) * 2 - 150;

  const img = d.image_path ? images[d.image_path] : null;
  if (!img || img.width === 0) return;

  // fit image proportionally
  const imgRatio = img.width / img.height;
  const boxRatio = imgW / imgH;
  let drawW, drawH;

  if (imgRatio > boxRatio) {
    drawW = imgW;
    drawH = imgW / imgRatio;
  } else {
    drawH = imgH;
    drawW = imgH * imgRatio;
  }

  const cx = imgX + (imgW - drawW) / 2;
  const cy = imgY + (imgH - drawH) / 2;

  // normalize contrast (auto-levels)
  const leveled = autoLevelsGray(src, LEVELS_CLIP_LOW, LEVELS_CLIP_HIGH, LEVELS_GAMMA);

  // convert to halftone using Bayer dithering
  const dithered = (DITHER_MATRIX === '8x8')
    ? bayerDither8x8(leveled, DITHER_GAIN, DITHER_BIAS)
    : bayerDither4x4(leveled, DITHER_GAIN, DITHER_BIAS);

  layer.image(dithered.get(), cx, cy);

          <h4>System Implementation with EasyGrid</h4>
          <p>
            The system uses <strong>EasyGrid</strong> for layout management, making positioning and spacing systematic.
            The
            pseudocode establishes: 3 columns × 5 rows (adjustable), RISO layers (coral for circuits, teal for text),
            and visual
            rules using the <code>map()</code> function—circuit density maps to release year, category determines shape
            (audio =
            circle, storage = square, display = triangle, computing = hexagon, gaming = pentagon), and discontinued year
            affects
            opacity.
          </p>

          <h4>Where Are These Devices Today?</h4>
          <p>
            Many of these objects still exist, just not where we expect. Some are lost inside closets and junk drawers,
            too important
            to throw away but too outdated to use. Others are museum artifacts with plaques explaining their
            once-revolutionary features.
            A few are collector trophies auctioned online for high prices. Meanwhile, mountains of similar devices are
            buried in e-waste
            streams around the world. This spread—from trash to treasure—shows how unevenly we value the past.
          </p>

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Department of Lost Circuits is becoming both a historical archive and a meditation on obsolescence. By
            transforming
            discarded technologies into carefully printed artifacts, the series asks what it means to preserve digital
            culture in
            material form and whether code can act as a new kind of conservation tool. Working on this project shifted
            my attention
            from objects to their afterlives. Consumer technology does not disappear. It simply becomes invisible.

              <p>
                This was genuinely my first time using a pen plotter. There was a phase a while ago when I became
                obsessed with watching
                plotter drawings online—videos of machines slowly tracing ink, artists plotting geometric patterns with
                multiple pens, and
                long, meditative drawing processes. I was tempted to get one for home use, but that phase eventually
                faded.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now it's come back in a much more meaningful way. Seeing what's possible with plotting beyond pure
                machine drawing has
                shifted my perspective. Plotters aren't just mechanical tools; they're being used for textile
                patterning, experimental
                circuitry, and even edible ink drawings on cookies (which I very much want to try). That realization
                made me want to
                explore the plotter as a bridge between design, code, and fabrication.
              </p>

              <h4>A Brief History of Core Memory</h4>
              <figure class="inline-figure">
                <img src="assets/plot/examples.png" alt="historical examples of magnetic core memory" />
                <figcaption class="muted">
                  historical examples of magnetic core memory planes and woven circuits
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                I created a generative pattern inspired by <strong>magnetic core memory</strong>, one of the earliest
                forms of computer
                memory used from the 1950s through the early 1970s. Core memory consisted of tiny ferrite rings
                ("cores") woven into a
                grid of wires, each magnetized in one of two directions to represent a binary 1 or 0. It was both an
                engineering marvel
                and a hand-crafted object—the physical fabric of computation before silicon chips.
              </p>

              <p>
                Invented in the late 1940s by Jay Forrester at MIT's Whirlwind project, core memory became the standard
                for computers
                throughout the 1950s and 60s. It powered machines like the IBM 1401 and the Apollo Guidance Computer.
                The first computers
                to fly to the Moon were literally woven by hand.
              </p>

              <p>
                What fascinates me most is that these memory planes were often assembled bywomen with
                  incredible dexterity,
                threading wires through microscopic rings using fine needles. Each bit of memory was physical, tangible,
                and placed with
                care. Core memory was textile computation: computing as weaving, logic as fabric, data as something soft
                and structured.
              </p>

              <h4>Pattern & Code</h4>
              <p>
                I've always been drawn to circuit art in all its forms—freeform soldering, wire sculptures, experimental
                PCBs, breadboard
                chaos. Circuits feel like drawings to me: technical, but deeply poetic. The grid-like weave of core
                memory sits perfectly
                at the intersection of textile and technology, structure and softness.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using p5.js with the p5.svg renderer, I built a system that generates a stylized "core memory panel,"
                complete with vertical
                and horizontal bus lines, crisscross stitches, and subtle imperfections. The pattern went through
                several iterations, adjusting
                density, spacing, stroke weight, wire behavior, and randomness until it felt digitally hand-woven rather
                than mechanically perfect.
              </p>

                  <strong>Machine Drawing Note:</strong> This drawing is not animated. It is computed once, like a print
                  pulled from a press.
                  The code behaves less like a sketch and more like a small drawing machine with adjustable "knobs."

                <div class="details-content">
                  <h4>The Drawing is Parametric</h4>
                  <p>A handful of global variables define the entire system:</p>
                  <pre><code>let seed = 42;                 // reproducible variations
let coreSpacing = 35;          // grid density
let coreSize = 18;             // motif scale
let coreThickness = 6;         // ring thickness
let seamless = true;           // infinite tiling
let plotMode = true;           // stroke-only plotting</code></pre>

                  <h4>Single-Frame, Print-First Logic</h4>
                  <pre><code>randomSeed(seed);
noLoop();</code></pre>

                  <h4>Drawing Pipeline (Layers)</h4>
                  <pre><code>const { cols, rows, startX, startY } = computeGridParams();
drawVerticalWires(cols, rows, startX, startY);
drawHorizontalWires(cols, rows, startX, startY);
drawDiagonalWires(cols, rows, startX, startY);
drawAllCores(cols, rows, startX, startY);</code></pre>

                  <h4>Controlled Imperfection</h4>
                  <pre><code>const jitterX = random(-0.5, 0.5);
const jitterY = random(-0.5, 0.5);

if (random() > 0.02) {
  drawCorePlot(x + jitterX, y + jitterY);
}</code></pre>

                  <p>
                    This introduces softness without breaking the underlying structure—the machine hesitates, but never
                    collapses.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </details>

              <h4>Iterations</h4>
              <p>I plotted three different physical iterations from the final code:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Industrial version</strong> — plotted on brown craft board, evoking mid-century lab hardware
                </li>
                <li><strong>Minimal version</strong> — black on white, emphasizing geometry and structure</li>
                <li><strong>Textured multi-ink version</strong> — layered lines and overlapping color, messy and dense,
                  closer to how
                  real core memory looks under magnification</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The final plot took nearly two hours to complete and even ran one of my pens dry halfway through,
                causing a subtle color
                shift. I changed pens to mask it, but that accident gave the piece a layered quality I ended up liking.
                Even after producing
                three versions, I'm still undecided on which one I like most. Each represents a different side of my
                ongoing fascination with
                magnetic core memory as both an aesthetic system and emotional artifact.
              </p>

              <h4>Process Notes</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Plotter:</strong> AxiDraw pen plotter</li>
                <li><strong>Pens:</strong> Sakura Gelly Roll, Micron 005</li>
                <li><strong>Paper:</strong> cardboard board + cardstock</li>
                <li><strong>Plot time:</strong> ~25–30 min (first two), ~2 hours (final)</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="muted">
                Watching the plotter slowly trace each ring and wire felt meditative—a form of slow computation that
                echoes the
                original labor of weaving memory by hand. It sits somewhere between digital precision and human care.

                There's a moment in many electronics tutorials where everything becomes rigid. The language hardens. The
                diagrams flatten.
                Touch disappears. Electricity becomes something you control, not something you feel. This small zine
                began as a refusal
                of that moment—and also as my first actual zine.

                <em>How to Touch Electricity (Soft Circuits for Soft Beings)</em> was created for Experimental
                Publishing: Tutorial as Art,
                an assignment that asks us to treat tutorials not just as instructional tools, but as cultural and
                artistic objects. Rather
                than focusing on efficiency or mastery, the project explores what happens when a tutorial becomes
                poetic, tactile, and
                emotionally aware.

              <p>
                The zine is a simple, hands-on guide to soft circuits that teaches basic electronic ideas—connection,
                resistance, flow—through
                gentle, embodied interaction. It is paired with a small physical kit, allowing the reader to build and
                activate each circuit
                directly (coin battery, copper tape, spare LED sticker).
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Rather than asking "How does this work?" the zine asks: <strong>What does electricity feel like when
                    we meet it softly?</strong>
                </p>
              </div>

              <h4>Circuits as Gestures</h4>
              <p>Each page introduces a small gesture for touching electricity. These gestures are intentionally slow,
                minimal, and accessible:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>pressing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>tracing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>folding</strong></li>
                <li><strong>holding</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Each gesture corresponds to a flat, low-voltage paper circuit that can be built using materials from the
                accompanying kit:
                copper tape, LEDs, graphite, and a coin cell. The reader doesn't just observe the circuit; they assemble
                it, touch it, and
                feel how it responds. A light turns on with a gentle press. Brightness shifts as a finger traces
                graphite. A fold closes a
                circuit that wasn't connected before. In these moments, touch becomes the interface.
              </p>

              <h4>Electricity as a Relationship</h4>
              <p>Alongside the circuits are short poetic reflections that reinterpret electronic components through
                emotional and sensory language:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>resistance becomes <strong>hesitation</strong></li>
                <li>voltage becomes <strong>intensity</strong></li>
                <li>current becomes <strong>flow</strong></li>
                <li>ground becomes <strong>safety</strong></li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This reframing aligns with the spirit of the assignment, which encourages tutorials that provoke
                reflection or reframe familiar
                systems. Electronics are often taught as rigid and unforgiving; this zine instead treats electricity as
                something
                relational—responsive to pressure, proximity, and care. Electricity is not positioned as something to
                dominate, but as something
                to engage with gently.
              </p>

              <h4>The Zine + Kit</h4>
              <p>
                The project includes a small, basic kit meant to lower the barrier to experimentation. It contains only
                essential materials and
                encourages hands-on exploration rather than perfect outcomes. Pairing the zine with a kit was important
                to me. Reading, making,
                and touching happen together, and the circuits remain visible, imperfect, and human.
              </p>

              <h4>Why a Tutorial as Art?</h4>
              <p>
                This project connects to my ongoing interest in soft computing, e-textiles, and care-based approaches to
                interaction design.
                The "tutorial as art" format made space to treat instruction itself as a creative medium—one that can
                carry tone, values, and
                emotion. Soft circuits slow things down. They make room for uncertainty. They allow electronics to feel
                approachable rather than
                intimidating.
              </p>

              <h4>What I Learned</h4>
              <p>Working on this project, especially as my first zine, reinforced a few key ideas:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Touch can be a meaningful input without complex sensors</li>
                <li>Learning electronics doesn't have to begin with abstraction</li>
                <li>Simple materials can support rich interaction</li>
                <li>Making something small makes experimentation feel possible</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Most importantly, I learned that gentleness is not the opposite of rigor. It's simply a different
                interface.</p>

              <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
              <p>
                Making this zine was genuinely fun. The format felt intimate and flexible, and the process of writing,
                building, assembling,
                and testing by hand made the work feel alive. As a first zine, it gave me confidence and made me excited
                about what else this
                format can hold—perhaps a volume 2? more tutorials? more circuits?
              </p>

                Electricity doesn't always need to be commanded. Sometimes, it just needs to be touched. ☻

              <p>
                This project was created for Experimental Publishing Part B, an assignment focused on experimental
                publication as a way of
                capturing systems, datasets, and cultural forms through print and code. The brief asked us to work with
                printing or plotting,
                use code somewhere in the process, and consider publishing not just as output, but as concept.
              </p>

              <p>For this project, I chose to work with something I encounter constantly but usually try to erase:
                <strong>errors</strong>.</p>

              <h4>Concept</h4>
              <p>
                <em>debug.log — a system trying its best</em> is an experimental publication built from real software
                and hardware error
                messages collected from my own creative coding and electronics practice: WiFi failures, parsing errors,
                memory errors, serial
                port issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rather than treating these errors as problems to be fixed, I treated them as a dataset. Each error
                message is paired with a
                "tender" interpretation—rewriting the failure as if the system had emotional states: shyness, fatigue,
                hesitation, confusion.
                The original technical language remains intact, but its meaning shifts.
              </p>

              <p>Instead of resolving failure, the project reframes it.</p>

              <p>Conceptually, the work sits between:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>publishing a found or collected dataset</li>
                <li>redesigning a mundane technical interface into something emotional</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The goal was not to aestheticize error, but to archive it—to let failure exist as documentation.</p>

              <h4>Form & Design</h4>
              <p>
                The publication is intentionally restrained and archival. It references early software logs and
                command-line interfaces,
                particularly 1990s-era debugging consoles. The visual language is rigid, plain, and utilitarian. There
                are no decorative
                gestures. This was a deliberate choice: by keeping the formatting strict, the emotional weight lives
                entirely in the language.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The system looks cold. The text is soft. That tension is the work.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                The project also operates as a quiet parody of technical documentation and debugging culture, adopting
                the visual language of
                system logs while subverting their usual tone of urgency and authority.
              </p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>I began by slowly collecting/keeping track of error messages over time from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arduino projects</li>
                <li>p5.js sketches</li>
                <li>WiFi connections</li>
                <li>machine learning web experiments</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I selected entries that felt common, repetitive, or emotionally resonant—failures that occur not because
                something is broken,
                but because something is trying.
              </p>

              <p>
                I then built a coded layout system using p5.js. Rather than using code to generate imagery, I used it as
                a design system.
                The sketch generates timestamps, shuffles the dataset deterministically, assigns error levels (error /
                warning / info), and
                formats each entry into a Windows-95-style console layout. All hierarchy, spacing, and formatting are
                generated through code
                rather than manual layout decisions.
              </p>

              <h4>Production & Display</h4>
              <p>
                The printed work is presented using clear sleeves, binder clips, clipboards, and archive
                labels—materials that reference
                institutional documentation, lab records, and system logs. One copy functions as the primary archival
                artifact. The remaining
                copies are displayed as a small distribution stack, emphasizing that this is a log meant to be shared,
                handled, and read, not
                framed as a decorative object.
              </p>

              <h4>Connection to The Soft Computer (Tiny Thesis Experiment)</h4>
              <p>
                This project also functioned as an early experiment for my thesis, which explores the idea of the
                <strong>Soft Computer</strong>:
                a form of computing that prioritizes emotional awareness, care, and vulnerability over efficiency and
                optimization.
              </p>

              <p>
                Within that trajectory, <em>debug.log</em> contributes to an ongoing framework I refer to as
                <strong>Tender Errors</strong>:
                a practice of noticing, collecting, and reinterpreting moments of technical failure as meaningful
                records rather than interruptions
                to be erased.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rather than building a new interface or device, this project softens an existing one. The debugging
                console, normally a site of
                urgency, frustration, and control, becomes a space for reflection and care. This mirrors a central
                question in my thesis work:
                what might computing look like if systems were allowed to acknowledge effort, fatigue, and uncertainty?
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  <strong>Short Reflection:</strong> Working on this project shifted how I think about failure in my own
                  practice. Instead of
                  seeing errors as interruptions, I began to see them as emotional records—quiet evidence of persistence
                  inside technical systems.
                  Keeping the design visually quiet allowed the language to carry the emotional weight. The system does
                  not apologize or resolve
                  itself. It simply admits that it is trying.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h4>Toward Edition 02</h4>
              <p><em>debug.log</em> feels like the first artifact in a longer publishing practice connected to my
                thesis.</p>
              <p>A future Edition 02 could expand the work by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>collecting errors over a longer period of time, allowing emotional patterns to emerge</li>
                <li>incorporating hardware and environmental failures, such as sensor noise or unstable power</li>
                <li>introducing material degradation—fading ink, paper variation, disrupted formatting—as another layer
                  of system "state"</li>
                <li>allowing the log to subtly change between printings, reflecting instability over time</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Rather than escalating in scale, the next edition would deepen the archive—continuing to document
                systems not at their most
                powerful, but at their most human level.
              </p>
